This is a custom Library created for the Arduino IDE intended to be used to communicate more easily with the "BBWAS", a custom PCB Shield created by BBW (https://www.bbw.ch/)

To use this Library, simply download the whole project, and extract it into a folder called "BBWAS" then place this Folder in your Arduino-Library Folder.

The libraries Folder per default is located in at C:\Users\your_user_name\Documents\Arduino\libraries.

Then you can just include the Library in any Sketch by adding #include<BBWAS.h>
